# Armadillo Madness Game Manual

## Overview

- Armadillo Madness game manual.

### General Game Intructions

- You move and try to dodge Obstacles and shoot or jump on bad guys.
- You can run under/through all Obstacles without being hurt, but watch out there might be baddies behind them!
- You can jump over obstacles but landing on them hurts you.
- The Tree is the only obstacle that can be jumped on or landed on without taking damage.
- If something is out of reach try bouncing off a tree then a bad guy to reach it!
- Landing on bad guys reduces their health. 2 to 3 hits kills bad guys.
- shooting badguys with poop hurts them.
- Poop can't go through obstacles.
- When you take damage, you can't take more for a short period, this lets you go mad allowing you to bounce all through bad guys!
- Shooting bad guys gives you more points than jumping on them.
- There are two levels with two Bosses and jumping on or hiting up on them with the killing blow gives you the most points!

### Power Upss

- **Mushroom**: Makes you invincible for longer and gives you movement speed. This lets you pull off some crazy combos!
- **Can 'o' Food**: Gives you super poops that shoot through all bad guys and obstacles.
- **Grav-Boots**: lets you jump higher and stay in the air longer.
- All power up timers stack and chain meaning you can have all of them at the same time and getting one power up while all are active extends the time on them all.

### Stats and health

- You start with 6 hearts and if you lose them all then the game is over.
- You can see how many hearts you have left in the top right of the Game screen.
- Your score is dispalyed in the top left as well.
- Along with powerUp and invulnerable timers.

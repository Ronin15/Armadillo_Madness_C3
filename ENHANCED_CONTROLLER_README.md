# Enhanced Controller Support for Armadillo Madness

## New Features

### Improved Controller Detection

1. **Multiple Detection Methods**:
   - Standard detection at startup
   - Forced detection for problematic controllers
   - Periodic checks for newly connected controllers
   - Raw button scanning for direct hardware detection

2. **Debug Tools**:
   - Press F1 to toggle detailed controller debugging
   - Press F2 to perform raw button scanning
   - In-game HUD shows controller status
   - Detailed console output of controller state

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Better handling of generic/unnamed controllers
   - Fallback to default controller if specific detection fails
   - More robust handling of connection/disconnection

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. Connect your controller before starting the game
2. The game will attempt to detect it automatically
3. If detected, you'll see "Controller: [Name] (#ID)" in the game HUD
4. Use the controller as described in the original README

### Troubleshooting

1. **If no controller is detected:**
   - Check the HUD, which will show "No controller detected"
   - Press F2 to run a raw button scan
   - Try pressing buttons on your controller to see if they register
   - Restart the game with the controller already connected

2. **If buttons don't work as expected:**
   - Press F1 to enable debugging
   - Press each button and observe the console output
   - Note which button numbers correspond to which physical buttons
   - You can see which axes are active when moving analog sticks

### For Developers

The controller implementation now includes:

1. **Enhanced `init_controllers()`** - More robust detection with better logging
2. **New `check_for_new_controllers()`** - Periodic scanning for newly connected devices
3. **New `force_controller_init()`** - Fallback method for controllers not detected normally
4. **New `check_raw_buttons()`** - Direct hardware scanning for button presses
5. **Updated HUD** - Shows controller status and helpful debug commands

## Testing Your Controller

To properly test if your controller works with the game:

1. Start the game with the controller connected
2. Check if it's detected in the HUD
3. If not, press F2 to run a raw scan
4. Press F1 to enable debugging
5. Press various buttons and move sticks
6. Watch the console output to see what's being detected

## Compatibility Notes

- The implementation uses Raylib's gamepad functions
- It should work with most standard controllers (Xbox, PlayStation, generic)
- Some controllers may need external drivers or mapping software

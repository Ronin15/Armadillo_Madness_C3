Notes:

    Need to implement more levels only two planned so far. If successful will add more. This is a game that my 6-year-old at the time helped design and provided inspiration for the art.
    The Title page song with the Harmonica is her playing her Harmonica.
    The Art is either from my 6-year-old or my wife's concept art.
    Any support is extremely appreciated.
